# Audio-Frequency-Comparison-and-Voice-Similarity-Evaluation
This project is an advanced audio similarity analyzer that compares two audio recordings using MFCC features, frequency-domain analysis, and time-domain waveforms. It outputs a clean visual dashboard with time-series graphs, frequency plots, MFCC heatmaps, and a similarity score.
